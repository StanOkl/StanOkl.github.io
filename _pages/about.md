Hello! I am currently a Visiting Assistant Professor at [UC Riverside's School of Public Policy.](https://spp.ucr.edu/) I hold a Ph.D. in Political Science from UC San Diego. 

My current research focuses on state and local politics with special attention to housing policy. Previously, my research involved used computational social science tools to answer questions about campaign finance and election law in the United States. I've been published in *Electoral Studies*, *Research & Politics*, *Socius* and *State Politics & Policy Quarterly*. I also hold a Master of Public Policy from the University of Southern California's Price School and a BA in Sociology from UC Davis.
