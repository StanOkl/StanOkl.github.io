Hello! I am currently a Post-Doctoral Fellow at [Claremont McKenna College's Policy Lab](https://policylab.cmc.edu/). I hold a Ph.D. in Political Science from UC San Diego. 

My research interests involve using computational social science tools to answer questions about campaign finance and election law in the United States. My work has been published in *Electoral Studies*, *Research & Politics* and *State Politics & Policy Quarterly*. I also hold a Master of Public Policy from the University of Southern California and a BA in Sociology from UC Davis. 

I also created [this map](http://acsweb.ucsd.edu/~soklobdz/covid_map.html) which provides a daily update on COVID-19 cases in the United States based on data collected by the [New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data).
