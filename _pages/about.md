Hi! I'm currently an Assistant Professor at the [University of California, Riverside's School of Public Policy](https://spp.ucr.edu/).

My research focuses on state and local politics with special attention to housing policy. I'm also interested in using computational social science tools to answer questions about interest group behavior and political economy generally. My work has been published in journals such as
*The American Political Science Review*, *The Journal of Economic Perspectives*, *Electoral Studies*, *Research & Politics*, *Socius* and *State Politics & Policy Quarterly*. 

I hold a PhD in Political Science from UC San Diego, a Master of Public Policy from the University of Southern California's Price School and a BA in Sociology from UC Davis. 

I also have a Substack about California politics and policy called ["Everyone is Welcome."](https://everyoneiswelcome.substack.com/)
