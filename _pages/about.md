Hello! I am currently the Research Director for [California YIMBY](https://cayimby.org/), a group working to end California's housing crisis. I hold a Ph.D. in Political Science from UC San Diego. 

My current work focuses on how interest groups work through state and local government to restrict the supply of housing. Previously, my research involved using computational social science tools to answer questions about campaign finance and election law in the United States. My work has been published in *Electoral Studies*, *Research & Politics*, *Socius* and *State Politics & Policy Quarterly*. I also hold a Master of Public Policy from the University of Southern California's Price School and a BA in Sociology from UC Davis.
