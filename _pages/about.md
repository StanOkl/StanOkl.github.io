Hello! I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Political Science at UC San Diego. Starting this summer, I'll be a Post-Doctoral Fellow at Claremont McKenna College. 

My research interests involve using computational social science tools to answer questions about campaign finance and election law in the United States. My work has been published in *Electoral Studies*, *Research & Politics* and *State Politics & Policy Quarterly*. I hold a Master of Public Policy from the University of Southern California and a BA in Sociology from UC Davis.
