# COVID-19 Map, [Updated Daily from NYT Data](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) ).

A compliment to the [map created by the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html) showing the spread of COVID-19 cases by U.S. County. Unlike the Times' map, this map is normalized by county population size to show the penetration of COVID-19 cases. Counties are shaded based on the number of cases per 1,000 residents as of the 2018 census. Information on the raw number cases and deaths, as well as rates per 1,000 residents and the five-day increase in cases per 1,000 residents are also available by hovering over the county. 


A note on the data: The New York Times aggregated all five boroughs of New York City into one geographic entity. To map it, I condensed data on that city to the borough of Manhattan, (New York County.) Similarly, the Times created a separate geographic entity for Kansas City Missouri. I reaggregated those cases to Jackson County, Missouri which houses that city. 


This map updates daily at 12:00 AM Los Angeles time.
