1. [The Noisy Neighbor Effect: How Negative Advertising in One State Influences Viewers Next Door.](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3337099)

...**Abstract:** The Supreme Court’s 2010 decision in Citizens United v. FEC unlocked a flood of new political advertising at all levels of government, leaving voters to decipher an unprecedented level of information before eventually casting their ballots. How competent are voters at sorting through all this information and shaping opinions based on relevant information? I exploit variations in state-election law and the timing of gubernatorial races to create a natural experiment on how seemingly irrelevant information can shape voter attitudes. I find that, all else equal, those living in multi-state media markets who were exposed to negative television ads for a gubernatorial race taking place in a neighboring state were more disapproving of their own governors than other residents of their state. This same exposure to out-of-state  gubernatorial ads also led residents to rate their own governor’s as more ideologically distant from them. In a saturated era of political information–with a portion of it coming from active misinformation campaigns–the ability of voters to sift through and accurately process political messaging is vital to the function of democracy. These results call that ability into question and raise new implications for the regulation of political advertising in American elections.

2. [Buying the Ballot: Political Actors and Official Ballot Initiative Language](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3235539) 
...*with Mitch Downey, Economics, Stockholm IIES.*

...**Abstract:** At the time of their inception in the Progressive Era, ballot initiatives were intended as a way for citizens to wrest control of the policy making process away from politicians corrupted by special interests. However, this measure of popular sovereignty may not be as immune to meddling these same special interests as either the founders of direct democracy or the literature suggests. Many voters learn about initiatives only from the titles and summaries appearing on ballots, which are themselves written by elected politicians. We study that special interest groups influence the wording of these official ballot initiative summaries, showing that summaries are more likely to use supporters’ preferred language as supporters contributed more to the summary writer. This relationship holds true even when the summary writer is running for a different office and does not exist in summaries written by an independent, apolitical non-profit group. We then show that donors are more likely to give to Attorney General candidates when relevant initiatives appear on the ballot. This result is not reflected in broader state-level political activity and exists only in states where the Attorney General writes the summary. Our results show the risks of tasking elected officials with fundamentally bureaucratic tasks and indicate that this process designed to reduce the power of special interests over the legislative process may have actually given them another avenue of control.

3. [The Supply and Demand of Fact v. Opinion in Presidential Tweets.](http://acsweb.ucsd.edu/~soklobdz/kousser_oklobdzija_tweets.pdf)
...*with Thad Kousser, UCSD Political Science.*

...**Abstract:** Do presidential candidates, and now President Trump, use social media to
lay out the factual basis for their positions, or do they primarily communicate their values and opinions? We investigate this question by using human categorizations of over 8,000 tweets to train machine learning algorithms to code all of the tweets sent by all 23 candidates during and since the 2016 presidential election campaign. We argue that politicians should supply more opinions than facts, in order to match voter demand for opinion over fact and increase audience engagement with their tweets.
In a descriptive analysis, we chart the flow of factual claims – many of which
happen to be false, according to prominent fact-checking websites – versus opinion over the course of the campaign and across candidates. Donald Trump leaned heavily toward opinion during the campaign, but so did Hillary Clinton and many of the of the most successful candidates. Turning to the demand for tweets, we analyze the rate at which a candidate’s tweet is liked or retweeted, relative to her number of followers. We find that, for nearly every candidate, tweets that espouse an opinion generate significantly more engagement than factual claims. Negative opinions are especially engaging. These findings persist in multivariate models that hold constant the tone, subject matter, and ideology of the tweet, providing strong evidence that voters are more responsive to opinion than fact on social media.

4. [All the President’s Tweets: Studying the Big Data of Twitter Political Communication with a Small Data Approach.](http://acsweb.ucsd.edu/~soklobdz/All_the_President%E2%80%99s_Tweets.pdf)
...*with Thad Kousser, UCSD Political Science.*

...*Abstract:* This paper describes and demonstrates an approach to studying political communication on Twitter that combines the flexibility and subtlety of human coding on small datasets with the scalability of big data methods. We apply this method to study the 152,134 tweets sent by candidates and their SuperPACs during the 2016 American presidential election. We begin by outlining the importance of studying this increasingly prominent form of political communication, laying out both the
opportunities and obstacles to analyzing the massive volume of social media political texts. We then explain our supervised learning method to classify the ideology and sentiment of tweets, what policy spheres they address, whether they make factual
statements or espouse opinions, and other characteristics. To demonstrate what this approach to studying political communication can tell us about a campaign, we then focus on our measure of ideology. We map the candidates on a spatial spectrum based on their social media rhetoric, explore Donald Trump’s unique brand of populism by looking at where he placed himself on different issues, and asked whether he and Hillary Clinton followed the Downsian impulse to moderate their message from the primary to the general election.

5. Super PAC Insurance: How Market-Based Campaign Finance Reform Would Look. 
...*with Nick Warshaw, JD, UCLA School of Law.*

...*Abstract:* Since the Citizens United decision in 2010, super PACs have grown to dominate the American campaign finance landscape. With the ability to raise unlimited amounts of money, a super PAC can quickly dominate the airwaves during an election—dramatically altering an election and raising serious concerns for effective representation. To counteract super PAC spending, we propose an old business model, insurance, for a new market vertical, super PACs. An insurance model can protect insured candidates from Super PAC expenditures, reduce the influence of money and politics and produce a return for its investors–all with no investment of public funds and without changing any existing campaign finance laws or regulations. Our paper demonstrates not only the financially viability of super PAC insurance, but outlines the legal viability of such a proposal as well.   To determine the price of candidate premiums, we use Federal Elections Commission (FEC) data to produce a count model that predicts the approximate dollar level of super PAC spending in a candidate race based on a series of factors. Further, we demonstrate the feasibility of effectively predicting super PAC spending using an ensemble learning method. Being able to forecast which raises a super PAC will enter and approximately how much they will spend allows for the creation of sound premiums to guard against a market collapse. The results of our study speak not just to the business model of super PAC insurance, but to a new strategy in combating the effects of money-in-politics.
